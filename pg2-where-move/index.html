            <h2>Where can you move?</h2>
            <p>When looking for a new place to move, it is always important to consider the viability of holding multiple passports in that country. Many countries have different laws that apply to where you may or may not be able to hold a second passport in.</p>

          <h2>Permitted</h2>
          <p>As you can tell, there is a range of countries that allow dual citizenship throughout every continent.  Generally, this means you're able to work, live, and travel in these countries without any restrictions or repercussions caused by owning another passport.  However, this is not always the case with every country.</p>

          <h2>Permitted With Restrictions / Not Permitted With Exceptions</h2>
          <p>Some countries may generally allow its nationals to hold multiple citizens, but only under specific circumstances.  These circumstances vary between country to country and each situation must be researched carefully.</p>

          <h2>Not Permitted</h2>
          <p>While it's impossible for one country to disallow you from gaining citizenship in another country, there are ways in which countries can deny its own citizenship to people in the case that they gain another citizenship.  This can be caused by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Possible or automatic loss of citizenship if another citizenship is acquired voluntarily</li>
            <li>Possible loss of citizenship if people with multiple citizenships do not renounce their other citizenship after reaching the age of majority (legal adulthood) or within a certain period of time after obtaining multiple citizenships</li>
            <li>Denying automatic citizenship by birth if the child may acquire another citizenship automatically at birth</li>
            <li>Requiring an applicant for naturalization to apply to renounce their existing citizenships, and provide proof from those countries that they have renounced the citizenship</li>
