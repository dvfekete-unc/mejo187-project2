        <section id="faq">
          <h1>FAQ</h1>
          <h2>What does it mean to have dual citizenship, or multiple citizenship?</h2>
          <p>Multiple citizenship is when a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one country under the laws of those countries.</p>

          <h2>Can Americans Abroad be taken as an official way to gain citizenship in another country?</h2>
          <p>Here at Americans Abroad, we wish to serve as a useful step for Americans thinking about gaining citizenship in another country by providing information that they can use to conduct further research about their particular situation.  However, we are not government officials that can grant citizenship to others.</p>

          <h2>What if there is little information on my country on this website?</h2>
          <p>Because American Abroad is aimed at Americans who are looking to live abroad, or nationals of other countries who are looking to live in the United States, our aim is to focus on the relationship between American nationality and the nationality of other countries.  National laws change constantly in many countries, or can be quite fluid, and it is difficult to maintain up-to-date information on every country specifically.</p>

          <h2>I am an American who lives abroad.  How can I get involved with this organization?</h2>
          <p>We are currently working on a forum section as well as an outlet for live chatting with Americans abroad.  If you would like to get involved in pioneering this feature, please send us an e-mail.</p>

          <h2>How can I donate to Americans Abroad?</h2>
          <p>We have a PayPal using the same e-mail as can be found in the About Us section below.  Thank you for supporting our cause!</p>
